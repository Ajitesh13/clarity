As said by Blaise Pascal, "Clarity of minds means clarity of passion" and one's passion make their life worth living. Inspired by this thought and taking into account the state of mental health in today's date, we decided
to work on something that we would find amazing to use. ✨

## 🙋 How does it work?
It's simple! Follow these steps:
1. Visit the app and you can pen down something.

3. Write down your emotions truly and that's it!
4. Click on submit and it will be stored as a little secret between us.
5. Want to know about your state of your mind few days back? Don't worry we will do that for you.
6. What to share it with some one else? We have something for that too.
